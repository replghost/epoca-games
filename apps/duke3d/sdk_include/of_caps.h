 * The OS populates a capability struct at a fixed BRAM address before

 * available hardware, memory layout, and OS services.
 *
 * This replaces hardcoded addresses (framebuffer base, audio reserve,
 * GPU MMIO window, ...) and enables the same app binary to run on
 * different targets (Pocket, MiSTer) and core variants (full, lite, 3d).
 *
 *   const struct of_capabilities *caps = of_get_caps();
